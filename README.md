This is a simple example on how flows.network works: When there is a trigger event happens on GitHub, an action gets set off (message sent) in Slack.

## Deploy your own GitHub Star Messenger bot in 2 simple steps

1. Load [the GitHub Star Slack Messenger](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/ten-github-star-slack-messenger)
2. Configure and authorize your Slack access
3. Configure the bot to follow the star growth of a specified GitHub repo

### 0 Prerequisites

You will need to sign into [flows.network](https://flows.network/) from your GitHub account. It is free.

### 1 Load the GitHub Star Slack Messenger template

[**Just click here**](https://flows.network/flow/createByTemplate/ten-github-star-slack-messenger)

Click on the **Create and Build** button.

### 2 Configure the bot to access your Slack


Next, you will tell the bot which Slack channel you want your alert messages to be sent to.

* `slack_channel`

Next, let's grant flows.network to access the Slack channel you just entered. The Slack channel must be public.

Click the "Connect/+ Add new authentication" button to authenticate your Slack account. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to install the `flows-network` bot on your workspace. This workspace is the one you entered into the `slack_workspace` above.


### 3 Configure the bot to access GitHub

Next, you will tell the bot which GitHub repo's star growth it needs to monitor.

* `github_owner`: GitHub org for the repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.
* `github_repo` : GitHub repo *you want to deploy the ðŸ¤– on*.

Click on the **Connect** or **+ Add new authentication** button to give the function access to the GitHub repo to deploy the ðŸ¤–. You'll be redirected to a new page where you must grant [flows.network](https://flows.network/) permission to the repo.
